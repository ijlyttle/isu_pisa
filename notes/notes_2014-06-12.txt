Hi Ames!
 
Hi CR!

Map:
-- what countries are not included
-- match country names
-- Plot countries not included
-- PV1, PV2, ... performance variables

Alex: averaged performance values

out of school hours interesting!
  finland low (finland is an educ model)
  kazakstan 24 hours!
  japan low
  
  parent income with student performance

Include other measures like 10 pctlile facetted not just median - IJL plots

NYT cartogram re: AIDS

Luke suggests supplementing data if need be from wikipedia

Possible threads:
  Do parents matter? Do students work hard outside of school to perform better
  How is income inequity related to performance?
  Composite home life index

compare immigration and emigration rates to gini

why do math gini's behave they way they do?

Possible variables to focus on:

   - type of mathematical ability (var 500 onwards)
   - country of birth, language (var 376 onwards, 449)
   - psychology - (var 79 on, 454, 495 on
   - parents table
   - teacher behavior, style (var 480...)
   - material possessions (var 44...., 284)
   - out of school activity (var 307...)
   

How should final student weight be incorporated?
